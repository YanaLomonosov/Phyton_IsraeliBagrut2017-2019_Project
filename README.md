# Israeli Bagrut 2017-2019

I chose to work with a dataset that shows average Bagrut (Israeli matriculation) exam scores from various cities and sectors in Israel, covering the years 2017 to 2019. The dataset contains around 44,000 records of 116 bagrut subjects in 306 different cities that shows 4 different sectors in the Israeli community. The data came from the site of the israeli movement for freedom of information: https://www.meida.org.il/11222.

I used 3 files in "ציוני הבגרות לפי שנים":

* 'התפלגות מספר נבחנים וממוצע ציון סופי לפי מוסד 2019.xlsx'
* 'התפלגות מספר נבחנים וממוצע ציון סופי לפי מוסד 2018.xlsx'
* 'התפלגות מספר נבחנים וממוצע ציון סופי לפי מוסד 2017.xlsx'
The goal of this project is to examine differences in Bagrut scores between sectors and jewish dominations in Israel, identify trends in the education system over time and between subjects.

## Main Research Questions:

### Distribution of Scores:

* Is the distribution is going right, left or it is normal? in other words, did the students in general pass the bagrut exams?
### Differences Between Sectors and Denominatins:

* Are there significant differences in average Bagrut scores between sectors?
### Trends Over Time:

* Do Bagrut scores change over the years 2017-2019?
* Are these changes consistent across sectors and subjects denominations?
### Subject Performance:

* What is the top 10 subjects every sector and denomination attends?
* How do sectors and denominations differ in their scores for English, Math, and native language (Hebrew/Arabic)?
## Tools and Techniques:
The analysis will be done using Python, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I will use descriptive statistics and visualizations such as histogram plots, bar plots, heatmaps and more.

## Workflow

1. Import the files
2. Concat the files
3. Cleaning the dataset
4. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Summery and conclusions
